PowerShell
==========

<b>Description: </b>This is a quick project one of my colleagues asked me to create for him. When this script is ran it parses all of the files in a directory to and calculates the file count and total files size of the files. The user then has the option to go ahead and delete the files, or cancel and not delete any files. The commands to delete files is currently commented out in the script.

<b>Below is the output when a users agrees to delete the files</b>
